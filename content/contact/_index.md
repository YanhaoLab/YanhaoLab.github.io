Our group explores novel quantum phenomena in 2D materials, bridging optics, condensed matter physics, and quantum device engineering. We invite motivated postdocs, graduates and undergraduates to join our collaborative team!  ​

 

## Why join us?
- Opportunities for high-impact journals, such as Science, Nature and its series.

- Work with advanced techniques, like plentiful optical spectroscopies, cryogenics, and microdevice fabrication.
- Enjoy novel and impactful research in a collaborative environment.


## For Graduates

We welcome PhD/Master candidates and undergraduates who passionate about novel physics and phenomena in a two-dimensional world, particularly, the van der Waals heterostructures.



## For Undergraduates
We seek students who have enthusiasm for quantum materials, optics, or device physics. By joining us, you can gain hands-on experience, overview of the cutting-edge research, and general idea about how to carry out a novel scientific project. Finally, we wish that you can develop your own scientific taste.



## How to join us?
Email a short self-introduction + academic background to [yanhaotc@zju.edu.cn]. You could join, but not limited, as follows:
- Lab courses (e.g., Modern Physics Experiments)
- Research programs (e.g., SRTP)
- Direct lab work
