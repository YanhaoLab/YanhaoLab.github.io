  intro: |
    Dr. Yanhao Tang, a tenure-track assistant professor in department of physics of Zhejiang University since 05/2021. He obtained the B.S. and Ph.D. from Peking University in 2011 and Michigan State University in 2017, respectively. Then, he joined the group of Prof. Kin Fai Mak and Prof. Jie Shan as a postdoctoral fellow from 2017 to 2021.

    He has mainly focused on the frontier research of optical spectroscopy and control of matter states in two-dimensional heterostructures, where the goal is to find new exotic states and learn some new phyics. By devoloping techniques such as ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, nonlinear optics, and multi-field control methods(e.g., magnetic/electric field and artificial periodic potential),  he has achieved influential results in the fields of moiré superlattice, strong correlation, exciton physics and valley dynamics, which have led to more than 10 papers published in well-established journals, such as Nature, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Materials, Nature Communications.
